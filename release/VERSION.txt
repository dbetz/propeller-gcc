#
# File VERSION.txt
#
# This file maintains the current propgcc version.
# Normally we release an image with a name like this:
#
#    image-name_VMajor_Minor_Build
#
# The underbar "_" is the version element delimiter.
# Only the image-name, major, and minor version are set here.
# The build version is maintained separately and appended by the build tool.
# The suffix is appended to the version by the build tool.
#
# As of June 2012 we don't use the propgcc_v*.txt files.
